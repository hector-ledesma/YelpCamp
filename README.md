# YelpCamp

In this final project from the [Web Developer Bootcamp *by Colt Steele*](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) we put everything we had learned into practice.

The entire project was done using the express framework. All the html and is rendered using .ejs templates.

The data was handled using MongoDB and Mongoose.

Authentication was done using the passport library.

## What I learned

On top of helping me develop my knowledge of JavaScript, working on this project allowed me to solidify my understanding of all of the fundamentals tackled in the course on a more complex level. Such as:

+ **Routing**

	Learned the importance and usage behind RESTful Routing. Applied all aspects of RESTful routing succesfully.
---
+ **Data**

	Using a mongo based database to manage all the data. Standard practices in creating object classes. Using mongoose objectIds for creating data association.
---
+ **Authentication and Authorization**
	
	Learned about the fundamentals of express authentication and authorization using passport js and creating middleware.
